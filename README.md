## What does this code do?
This is a game where the player trains to locate squares on a chess board fast. There are two options:
- find square: The player sees coordinates of a random square and they have to click on the corresponding square.
- name square: A random square is highlighted and the player has to write down its coordinates. </br>

Library used: pygame
## Motive behind this repo:

## How to contribute? Further Improvements:
- in the find square game: instead of writing the coordinates on the screen, emit an audio.
- in the name square game: instead of typing the coordinates, the user can pronounce them and we can use speech recognition to evaluate the answer.
